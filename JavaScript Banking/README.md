Create a javascript program (either you can use functional or class) to handle complete bank operations.

Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money. Watch out for concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make deposits and withdrawals. Shops can charge against the account.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.
